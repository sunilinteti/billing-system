Billing system assignment


Steps to checout the code and run Junit test cases.

1) Assuming Git is installed. Please clone the repository by running this command
    git clone https://github.com/sunilinteti/billing-system.git


2) Now we have the code repository
 This project can be imported into Eclipse and then Junit test cases can be run


Following are my assumptions in coding exercise

1) User object has userType and this is best userType wrt discount that user can avail. Constantly this has to be updated depending upon the status change of the user. Assuming this is not part of this code exercise but is being done by other business scenario

2) User has only one Usertype and he gets discount for item if it is discountable. 5 dollar discount on every 100$ purchase is appllied after applying the discount.

3)
